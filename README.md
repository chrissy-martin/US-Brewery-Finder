# US Brewery Finder
  

## Description

An app that lets a user find local breweries in a searched city. There is also an interactive map that shows the selected brewery's location. This application also shows the address and phone number for the selected brewery. The app was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and we used Tailwind CSS for our CSS framework. To gather the brewery data, we used Open Brewery Database API (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation). To gather the map and location data, we used Mapquest API (https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/).

## Contribution:

Feel free to contribute as desired! For future development, it would be great to add a search history with the ability to have a recently search city re-appear on the map when it is clicked in the history list. It would alos be nice to refine the map function and even add a way to retrieve directions to the brewery.

There are currrently no testing instructions.
